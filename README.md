This project aims to classify rock types using image classification methods powered by Tensorflow.

## Methodology ##
1. Data preparation
 - Find rock sample images 
 - Augment data for tf.data.Datasets
2. Data preprocessing
 - Feature Normalization
3. Build a TensorFlow model for the predictions

4. Train Model
 - Distribution Strategy: CPU
 - Hyperparameter tuning
 - Analyze Overfitting
5. Evaluate Model
 - Optimization 
 - Standardization
6. Deploy Model 
 - Android
